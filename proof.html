(link-reveal: "Firstly") [ – the bee stings you.] 

(link-reveal: "Secondly") [ – you sting the bee first.
This would involve but is not limited to:
Stepping on it. 
Swatting it. 	
Spraying it with soapy-water solution.
Or accidently sitting on one - do not recommend.]

(link-reveal: "Thirdly") [ – you wait for the global bee disappearance phenomenon to find you.

This is called Colony Collapse Disorder - aka CCD.]

(click-replace: "CCD") [[[click here to begin]]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="click here to begin" tags="" position="407,153" size="100,100">A young honey bee named Bobby had just started his pollinating career. He had only left the hive precisely 21 times to gather pollen. However, on the morning of his 22nd day, an [[emergency meeting]] was quickly announced for all honey bees. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="MISSING" tags="" position="411,401" size="100,100">“It has come to our attention,” Leo continued, “that Theodore is the most recent honey collector to have joined the many bees who have not returned home since leaving the hive for nectar.” 

Gasps from several bees around Bobby echoed throughout the hive and a loud chatter started to erupt. Packed together like penguins, the crowded bees started to shiver in a pulse. There was no denying it, they were frightened. 

“Quiet!” Leo yelled, “quiet everyone!” 

The room eventually calmed down. 

“We have no idea why our beloved friends are disappearing. And we have no idea if they will ever return. But we do know that this is more than just the threats of predators. More than just wrong place wrong time. We are being attacked by [[an unknown force]] and we should be scared." 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="follow his friends" tags="" position="338,790" size="100,100">Flying into the outside world, Bobby was bombarded with an array of beautiful scents drifting towards him [[right,]] [[left]] and [[centre.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="stay in the hive" tags="" position="488,790" size="100,100"> I see where you’re going with this. Eliminate yourself from the plight before it finds you, but unfortunately Bobby doesn’t have the luxury to stay hidden. He has a very important job to do and his hive needs him, so he must [[follow his friends]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="right," tags="" position="188,940" size="100,100">The aromatic smell of [[roses]] drifted Bobby to the right. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="left" tags="" position="339,940" size="100,100">The aromatic smell of [[lilies]] drifted Bobby to the left. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="centre." tags="" position="488,940" size="100,100">The aromatic smell of [[sweet, saccharine sugar]] made Bobby keep flying forward. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="roses" tags="" position="188,1091" size="100,100">As the flower fragrance became stronger and stronger and nearer and nearer, Bobby was soon met with a beautiful rose orchard. Wonderful arrays of pastel pinks and pearly whites danced across the field and all producing [[beautiful long pistils]].  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="beautiful long pistils" tags="" position="189,1239" size="100,100">Bobby flew to the first rose he saw and landed on its soft petals where his exhausted wings could rest. 

Bobby stuck his head into the heart of the flower and slurped up the liquid gold, immediately feeling rejuvenated. Once the rose was depleted of all its glory, he flew to the next one and repeated the process, feeling brighter and healthier from every bloom.  

By five hundred and thirty flowers, Bobby’s furry body was covered in pollen and his stomach was full of nectar, and once again he [[took off in flight.]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="continue his journey home" tags="" position="117,1389" size="100,100">Bobby made his way back home by following the sun’s directions until he arrived at the hive. 

“Great, Bobby!” said Leo, he was beaming, and he sounded relieved, “you’re back.” 

Bobby nodded quickly and proceeded to find himself a worker bee who could process his nectar into honey.

Once his stomach full of nectar was completely depleted, Bobby set out to [[forage again]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="visit the entrancing violets" tags="" position="251,1383" size="100,100">In one swift motion, Bobby spun around and flew head first towards the violets. He landed on the bloom with the grace of a droplet cascading in water and was simultaneously consumed with the sweet potent aroma and silkiness of the petal. He slipped his head inside the pistil to slurp up the nectar, but only the remnants of [[one drop remained]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="one drop remained" tags="" position="264,1539" size="100,100">Feelings of desolation erupted through him, for in that one taste he had felt an intoxicating ecstasy of flavour. Someone must have arrived here before him, he thought, probably an unruly wasp. He was about to leave when he spotted another pot plant of violets stationed in the middle of a table. 

Without hesitation, Bobby sped into the house and landed on the newly discovered flowers. And for the next few moments he bathed in the luxurious palate of the purple blooms and once he had finished, he dreamily crawled off the petal and [[lowered himself onto the solid wood beneath the flower pot]]. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="lowered himself onto the solid wood beneath the flower pot" tags="" position="264,1689" size="100,100">The last sound Bobby ever heard was a rushing of footsteps and a screeching shriek before [[everything went black]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="everything went black" tags="" position="186,1868" size="100,100">Cause of Death: shoe attached to a hand. Bobby died from an encounter with humans. Bees have got to be more careful. (colour: #3F63A6)[[Go Back -&gt;took off in flight.]] or (colour: #3F63A6)[[Choose a different path -&gt;follow his friends]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="forage again" tags="" position="115,1540" size="100,100">Continue to the [[same rose field]] or (colour: #3F63A6)[[choose a different route. -&gt;follow his friends]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="same rose field" tags="" position="40,1689" size="100,100">Bobby foraged again, and again, and again and again. 11 more times to be exact. Flying back and forth to his hive every hour. And he flew to the same rose orchard, and pollinated the same rose flowers that he had been pollinating all day and for the last three weeks. And to be honest, Bobby was getting sick of it. He had become so desensitised from the roses’ pollen that everything was tasting like sand. 

Then, he started to feel tired, like the type of fatigue that was synonymous with only eating paper for the last 21 days. And after a twelve-hour day, the sun had begun to set and Bobby took off in flight once again to fly back home. However, his wings weren’t vibrating as quickly as they usually would, and all of a sudden his body felt too heavy and then he was descending from the sky, crashing hard on a concrete path where his eyes started to flutter and [[his heart began to shut down]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="his heart began to shut down" tags="" position="41,1838" size="100,100">Cause of death: Monoculture. When bees pollinate acres and acres of the same flower, it can give them nutritional deficiencies. The lack of biodiversity can lead to malnourishment. (colour: #3F63A6)[[Choose a different path -&gt;follow his friends]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="lilies" tags="" position="339,1090" size="100,100">Bobby followed the intoxicating scent, and what he first perceived as the sweet scent of lilies was wrong because he was soon flying over an incredible apple orchard.

The next realisation Bobby noticed about the apple orchard was that there were hardly any other insects around.  

More for me, Bobby thought excitedly.

He landed on a bright green leaf. The leaf was thick enough that it didn’t bend or droop when his exhausted body finally alighted. The fruits had yet to sprout as Bobby slid off the emerald pad and towards the [[blooming flower]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="blooming flower" tags="" position="363,1239" size="100,100">Bobby drank the nectar like an animal that had been deprived of water for three days. He slurped every last drop in that flower, running his tongue until he was left with the tasteless flavour of the white petals. 

Bobby completed that heavenly act on forty more flowers, then rested. And it was during that recess that another thought had occurred. It was very peculiar that he hadn’t seen any caterpillars. Usually by his seventh flower, Bobby would accidently impose on a caterpillar sliding off a petal. In fact, he hadn’t spotted any slug residue or bite marks punctured out of the leaves and petals. 

After this strange discovery, Bobby decided to leave, either going [[back to the hive]] or finding a [[different blooming field]]. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="back to the hive" tags="" position="396,1439" size="100,100">Bobby flew home, his stomach full but his energy not as humble. When he found his hive, he was greeted by three bees guarding the small entrance and quickly flew in. 

“Amazing effort, Bobby!” Leo said, smiling brightly, “It’s great to have you back!” 

Bobby returned the smile. 

“Once you have [[regurgitated your findings]],” said Leo, “Be sure to find Patricia, she’s just returned from scouting the area and has found a blooming heaven!” Leo fans his face with his small twig fingers, blushing from the excitement. “She’s performing the waggle dance in the next hexagon for directions.” 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="different blooming field" tags="" position="539,1429" size="100,100">Bobby kept moving north, flying above small shrubs and medium trees. He stopped when he found another field, the citrus aura of the leaves screamed tangerine. Bobby relished in the discovery for he hadn’t tasted citrus in weeks. He landed on the first blossom he could see and immediately started gulping down the beautiful, tangy nectar. He drank from so many citrus blooms that he’d lost count and when the sun started to set he knew he had to [[fly home]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="regurgitated your findings" tags="" position="397,1589" size="100,100">Once Bobby donated his nectar to the worker bees he started to feel unlike himself: his appetite was gone, his balance was less than impeccable, and for the first time in his life he began to feel sick. His stomach was sore, and his body was shaking as if from the inside out. Not wanting to infect anyone else, he quickly but clumsily flew out of the hive and landed on a soft soil bed underneath a canopy of grass. And it was beneath the shadow of green that [[Bobby took his last moments of breath]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Bobby took his last moments of breath" tags="" position="396,1739" size="100,100">Cause of death: Neonicotinoids from the apple orchard. When a bee consumes the insecticide called neonicotinoid through pollen and nectar, it directly impacts the immune system and digestion system. This means that bees are more susceptible to diseases and mites. The use of neonicotinoids are a driving force in the contribution of the bee disappearance and colony collapse disorder. (colour: #3F63A6)[[Try again -&gt;blooming flower]] or (colour: #3F63A6)[[Choose a different path -&gt;follow his friends]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="fly home" tags="" position="550,1573" size="100,100">Bobby flew south from the tangerine orchard, left at a gum tree, then another sharp left over a bloomless wattle bush. Or was it right at the wattle bush? Bobby couldn’t remember. He knew he had to fly past the apple orchard, but he couldn’t remember where that was. He tried to smell the sweet apple blooms or the earlier lily scent, but he couldn’t smell anything. Bobby kept flying in loops, trying to spot any landmarks or notice any scent that was familiar, but he couldn’t. [[He was lost]] and had no way of getting back to his hive. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="He was lost" tags="" position="540,1715" size="100,100">Feeling exhausted after flying with no destination, Bobby descended from the sky and landed on a rock. He crawled into an unoccupied crevice and waited there until the sun left and the moon finally greeted him. And when the morning arrived [[Bobby could hardly move]], for a bee should never be away from their hive for so long. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Bobby could hardly move" tags="" position="486,1863" size="100,100">Feeling more exhausted than he had in his entire life, Bobby set out to fly again but he did not have the energy to do so, so [[he closed his eyes and never opened them again]].  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="he closed his eyes and never opened them again" tags="" position="533,2026" size="100,100">Cause of death: neonicotinoids from apple and orange orchard. The insecticide neonicotinoid can be consumed by bees when they pollinate flowers. This insecticide can majorly affect a bee’s navigational skills making it impossible for bees to find their way back to their hive, and since a bee can rarely survive 24 hours without it’s hive, the bee dies. (colour: #3F63A6)[[Choose a different path -&gt;follow his friends]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="sweet, saccharine sugar" tags="" position="581,1062" size="100,100">With the gusto of a fierce adventurer, Bobby sped through the sky as he followed the indulgent scent. He passed numerous trees and plants with deep green leaves that had yet to produce a bloom. 

Bobby breathed in the fragrance once again, unable to pinpoint exactly what it was. He smelled an array of flavours. It smelled fresh like sunflowers, but also citrusy like oranges and mandarins. Between the citrus layers he could also smell the undertones of daisies and hydrangeas, a perfume so sweet he could almost taste it. And when he couldn’t imagine the scent trail becoming any stronger, Bobby was thrusted into a [[utopian wonderland]] of bright colours and vibrant aromas. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="utopian wonderland" tags="" position="654,1186" size="100,100">The uncultivated land had allowed nature to fully run its course as every plant and flower worked together in harmony. Bobby flew to the first tree he saw and landed on thick citrus green leaves and as he inched closer to the small white flower of the orange tree he felt a wave of excitement. He dove head first into the bloom immediately drinking the nectar while his wings brushed the pollen on the rest of his body. Eager to try all the flavours of the rainbow, Bobby quickly bounced to the next plant he saw and almost fell from astonishment as he landed on the cascading magenta waterfalls of the amaranth flower. 

Knowing he could drink the sweet nectar of the amaranth flower forever if he didn’t force himself away, he continued his cycle around the forest garden. He bounced from a pink carnation to a bird of paradise, then from a marron orchid to a [[peace lily]]. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="peace lily" tags="" position="721,1321" size="100,100">By the time Bobby had finished, he had been lounging on the inside of a purple primrose where the delicate petals shadowed him from the fierce sun. Resting on his stomach, Bobby felt like he had just consumed an entire banquet. His belly was full of juicy nectar and his furry body was laden in gold pollen. After another moment’s rest, Bobby decided to fly back home. Following the angle of the light radiating from the sun, [[Bobby easily found his way back to the hive]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Bobby easily found his way back to the hive" tags="" position="721,1471" size="100,100">Once in the hive, Bobby flew to the worker bees, they were operating like clockwork in a busy but silent rhythm. He donated all his findings to them before flying back to the main hexagon filled with all the other honey bees.

“Welcome back, Bobby!” said Leo, his exhilarated voice bouncing in pitch. He was weaving between bees to get to him.

“Great to be back!” Bobby replied. 

“I heard you've found a flower paradise,” Leo said. 

“I sure did.” 

“Well, what are you still doing standing here?” Leo said enthusiastically, “do the [[waggle dance]] and show everyone where this amazing place is.” 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="waggle dance" tags="" position="722,1621" size="100,100">Bobby nodded immediately and started walking in a figure 8 pattern. Everyone quickly gathered around to watch him, and when his body intersected at the middle of the 8, he shimmied his body to show the path of the flower paradise. Bobby continued this motion for the rest of the day, telling newly arrive honey bees of the next pollinating location. 

By the end of that evening, every bee who had followed Bobby’s direction all arrived home safely with a bounty of food.  

[[Finished]] or (colour: #3F63A6)[[Try A Different Path -&gt;follow his friends]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Finished" tags="" position="700,1813" size="100,100">You have successfully completed the plight of the bee. 

There is nothing bees enjoy more than the abundance of fruits and flowers. The biodiversity of polyamorous farming creates an ecosystem of prosperity and health to all bees and insects alike. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="an unknown force" tags="" position="413,539" size="100,100">“Our colony has lost over a third of our population,” Leo continued. “And if I could, I would keep us all here to stay safe, but we need to eat,” he paused for a moment. “All I can say is keep your eyes open, your ears wide, and your wings buzzing.” 

A collection of “Hear, hear,” circulated the crowd. 

Leo straightened his spine, stood tall and gulped a deep breath. And when he lifted his head he said to everyone loudly, “alright honey bodies, let’s get some nectar and let’s make it home!” 

An uproar of cheers thundered through the air. And one by one, each bee filtered out of the hive and entered [[the human realm.]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="the human realm." tags="" position="413,658" size="100,100">Does Bobby [[follow his friends]] or does he [[stay in the hive]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="took off in flight." tags="" position="42,1248" size="100,100">He followed the same journey back home: turning right over a sea of houses, a sharp left at the oak tree, a dive around a water fountain. 

However, the bright fluorescent blue of violets captured his eyes. He had never seen such an invigorating purple before in his life. The violets were tiny, sitting quietly on a window pane, most bees would have flown right passed them. 

Bobby already had all the nectar and pollen he could dream of carrying, but he was intrigued with what taste a flower as majestic as violets could behold. 

Should he [[continue his journey home]] so that his hive could reap his wonderful bounty or should he [[visit the entrancing violets]]? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="emergency meeting" tags="" position="405,276" size="100,100">In a crowded clump, thousands of bees including Bobby gathered inside the top section of the hive. The walls were thick, lined with a wax more ancient than Bobby’s grandparents and eliminated most light from the outside world. Bobby always loved this part of the hive; the air was warmest there as the sun would hit the crown of the hive first. Sitting as silently as the bees’ buzzing bodies could allow, they drew their attention to the standing bee at the front. His name was Leo. 
 
“Thank you all for coming,” said Leo, his voice boomed across the sea of bees, diminishing any leftover chatter. He was holding a clipboard in his hands, moving back and forth in a horizontal line. In between his sauntering, Bobby could see he was stationed in front of a black chalk board where rectangular frames hung from pins. Bobby peered closer, and inside the frames were sketches, sketches of faces like his: a long round head, a fluffy face, big eyes. And above all these frames in big letters was the word
